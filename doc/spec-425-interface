What I'd like to see for the interface for #425

We have some modules in sample_work/ that know about what's in the sqlite
database, e.g., db.py ; I want to be able just to call a function in one 
of them and get the results back, thus:


from sample_work import db as sample_db

for organisation_id, test_id in sample_db.get_all_sample_failure():
	...
	...

where get_all_sample_failures() is either an iterator or a generator
