# Guide for Donor Organisations

We have conducted an initial assessment of your organisation's commitment to aid transparency and publication of information on
specific activities. This information has been collected for inclusion
in the 2014 Aid Transparency Index. Thank you for agreeing to review
this assessment.

Details of the indicators used in the Index, including how each
indicator is scored and weighted, can be found in the [scoring guide](http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/2014-ati/)

## Reviewing the assessment

For the 2014 Aid Transparency Index, data has been collected using two
tools - a Data Quality tool and a survey. If your organisation is an
IATI publisher then some of the data has been collected and scored
automatically using the Data Quality tool. Separate instructions on
how to access and review this data has been emailed to you. Information provided in other formats (Excel, CSV, website, PDFs)has been collected manually via the survey. If your organisation is not an IATI publisher then all the information is collected via the survey.

To ensure that the data is as accurate as possible, we would be
grateful if you could check the survey responses and correct or add
information as appropriate.

## Reviewing the survey data

Surveys have been completed using information relating to the country
that received the largest amount of aid by value from your
organisation. OECD DAC's 2012 [CRS](http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/usersguidetothecreditorreportingsystemcrsaidactivitiesdatabase.htm) data has been used for determining the largest recipient. If this information was not available in the CRS,
then the largest recipient was determined using the latest annual
report for the organisation or related organisation/ministry. For
activity level questions, five activities have been selected at random
in that country to establish that the information is consistently
published. Please confirm if the responses are representative as a
whole.

Please note that we are only looking at aid information which is:

* **Current**: For the purposes of the Index, "current" is defined as
published within the 12 months immediately prior to the data
collection period (1 April-30 June 2014), so information published on
1 April 2013 or later and that relates to that period is accepted as
current. Information published after 1 April 2013 but relating to a
period prior to then, for example 2012 CRS data, will not be accepted
as current. Documents that are not current under this definition are
accepted only if they are up to date with their regular cycle of
publication (for example, annual audits and evaluation reports) or if
they have explicit extensions written into them. Information provided
on static web pages is deemed as current unless information proving
the contrary is available.

* **Publicly available**: The information is available on the organisation's website or portal.

The survey is looking for specific information items. Each response
has been scored based on whether the information is 'always'
published, 'sometimes' published or 'not published'. The evidence for
where the information was found and any explanatory text is provided
alongside each question.


### Choices for responses:

1. Always published, i.e. systematically and regularly across all activities. 
2. Sometimes published, i.e. sporadically or not including the current year.
3. Not published.

Criteria for selecting 'always':

* Information is published for all projects assessed. This is
cross-checked for five different activities for the organisation,
selected at random.

Criteria for selecting 'sometimes':

* Information is published for some but not all projects; OR
* Qualifiers are stated which confirm publication is not comprehensive, i.e. "major projects", "lighthouse projects", "case studies", "key projects".

Criteria for selecting 'not published':

* The information is not published. For activity level questions, this
information is not being published for any of the projects assessed.

### Providing your feedback:

- Go to the 'Publication' section of the survey.
- The information items we are looking for are listed. To see a definition for each information item, click on it.
- Review each of the responses provided. If you agree with our assessment for that question, move on to the next question.
- If you disagree with our assessment or would like to provide additional information for any of the questions:
 1. Select your own response for the question.
 2. If the information is published, provide a URL as evidence. If the information is not published, please put N/A in the 'evidence' text box.
 3. For some questions, we would like to know the format that the information is provided in. There are three format choices: machine readable (Excel or CSV files), website or PDF. If you disagree with the selection made, please update it.
 4. In the comments box, please add any feedback or clarifications that you think will help us better understand your answer. This is particularly helpful if you think the response might be unclear or open to interpretation. Feel free to add any questions you have for us in the same box. It would also be helpful if you could let us know when you might be able to start publishing this information if you are not currently doing so.


### Submitting the survey

If you are unable to finish reviewing all the questions in a single
session or would like to review your responses at a later stage before
you submit the survey, please click on the 'save' button. You can
return to your saved results by logging in again. 

Once you finish reviewing the survey and have provided feedback,
please click on the 'submit response' button at the bottom of the
page.

After you submit your response, an independent reviewer will also be
provided with the opportunity to review the survey. Publish What You
Fund will then review all feedback received and take a final decision
on what information is currently published. You will be informed when
we have completed our review. We welcome feedback on our final
decision.

Thank you for reviewing the survey. If you have any questions or
