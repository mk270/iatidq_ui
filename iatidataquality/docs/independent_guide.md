# Guide for Independent Reviewers

We have conducted an initial assessment of 68 donor organisations, reviewing their overall commitment to aid transparency and checking what information they publish on their activities. This information will be included in the 2014 Aid Transparency Index.

Data has been collected using two tools - a Data Quality tool and a survey. If the organisation is an IATI publisher then some of its data has been collected and scored automatically using the Data Quality tool. Information provided in other formats (Excel, CSV, website, PDFs) has been collected manually via a survey. If the organisation is not an IATI publisher then all the information will be collected via the survey. The full list of information items we are looking for can be found [here](http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/2014-ati/).

To ensure that the survey data is as accurate as possible, we would be grateful if you could check the responses and correct or add information as appropriate. 


## Reviewing the survey data

Surveys have been completed using information relating to the country that received the largest amount of aid by value from the organisation. Some questions relate to individual activities or projects. To answer these questions, five activities/projects were selected at random in that country to establish that the information is consistently published. Donors were asked to confirm if the responses are representative as a whole.


Please note that we are only looking at aid information which is:

* **Current**: For the purposes of the Index, "current" is defined as
published within the 12 months immediately prior to the data
collection period (1 April-30 to June 2014), so information published on
1 April 2013 or later and that relates to that period is accepted as
current. Information published after 1 April 2013 but relating to a
period prior to then, for example 2012 CRS data, will not be accepted
as current. Documents that are not current under this definition are
accepted only if they are up to date with their regular cycle of
publication (for example, annual audits and evaluation reports) or if
they have explicit extensions written into them. Information provided
on static web pages is deemed as current unless information proving
the contrary is available.

* **Publicly available**: The information is available on the organisation's website or portal.

The survey is looking for specific information items. Each response
has been scored based on whether the information is 'always'
published, 'sometimes' published or 'not published'. The evidence for
where the information was found and any explanatory text is provided
alongside each question. 


###What donor organisations were asked to do:

Donor organisations were asked to check our responses to the survey and make any corrections or additions as needed. They were given the following selection of responses to choose from: 

1. Always published, i.e. systematically and regularly across all activities. 
2. Sometimes published, i.e. sporadically or not including the current year.
3. Not published.

The evidence for where the information is found and any explanatory text is provided alongside each response.
