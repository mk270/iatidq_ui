#Guide for Data Collection

Thank you for agreeing to contribute to the 2014 Aid Transparency Index process. The data you are collecting 
will help to accurately capture the levels of aid information available, show changes over time and facilitate 
clear, practical improvements in the availability of aid information.

##Filling the survey questionnaire

For the 2014 Aid Transparency Index, data will be collected using two tools - a Data Quality tool and a survey. 

If the organisation is an IATI publisher then some of its data will be collected and scored automatically using  the Data Quality tool. Information provided in other formats (Excel, CSV, website, PDFs) will be collected  manually via a survey. If the organisation is not an IATI publisher then all the information will be collected via the survey. The full list of information items we are looking for can be found [here](http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/2014-ati/).

Surveys are to be completed using information relating to the country that received the largest amount of aid by value from that donor organisation. This information has been provided separately. 

Please note that we are only looking at aid information which is:

* **Current**: For the purposes of the Index, "current" is defined as
published within the 12 months immediately prior to the data
collection period (1 April-30 June 2014), so information published on
1 April 2013 or later and that relates to that period is accepted as
current. Information published after 1 April 2013 but relating to a
period prior to then, for example 2012 CRS data, will not be accepted
as current. Documents that are not current under this definition are
accepted only if they are up to date with their regular cycle of
publication (for example, annual audits and evaluation reports) or if
they have explicit extensions written into them. Information provided
on static web pages is deemed as current unless information proving
the contrary is available.

* **Publicly available**: The information is available on the organisation's website or portal.

The survey is looking for specific information items. Each response
has been scored based on whether the information is 'always'
published, 'sometimes' published or 'not published'. The evidence for
where the information was found and any explanatory text is provided
alongside each question. 

There are two sections in the survey, covering commitment and publication. Only the section relating to publication needs to be completed at this time. 
**The responses for the commitment questions have been pre-filled by Publish What You Fund (because they use separate data sources).**

For activity level questions, **you should select at random a minimum of five activities in that country** to establish that the information is consistently published. While checking and verifying data, donor organisations 
will be asked to confirm if these responses are representative as a whole.

###To answer each question:

1. Go to the 'Publication' section of the survey.
2. The information items we are looking for are listed. To see a definition for 
each information item, click on it.
3.	The response to each information item that was used in the 2013 Index is available for reference. This may help identify where the information you are looking can be found (for example, links to project databases). Please note that this information may not be relevant for the 2014 Index if the country being assessed has changed. In addition, new information may be available or some of the links may be broken.  
3. Check if you can find the information we are looking for and select an answer from a choice of 'always 
published', 'sometimes published' or 'not published'. 
4. If the information is published, provide a URL as evidence. If the information is not published, please 
put N/A in the 'evidence' text box. 
5. For some questions, we would like to know the format that the information is provided in. For these 
questions, please select the format: machine readable (Excel or CSV files), website or PDF. If you are 
unsure of the format, please let us know using the comments box.
6. In the comments box, please add any feedback or clarifications that you think will help us better 
understand why you provided that answer. This is particularly helpful if you think the response might 
be unclear or open to interpretation. Feel free to add any questions you have for us in the same box.

### Choices for responses:

1. Always published, i.e. systematically and regularly across all activities. 
2. Sometimes published, i.e. sporadically or not including the current year.
3. Not published.

Criteria for selecting 'always':

* Information is published for all projects assessed. This needs to be
cross-checked for five different activities for the organisation,
selected at random.

Criteria for selecting 'sometimes':

* Information is published for some but not all projects; OR
* Qualifiers are stated which confirm publication is not comprehensive, i.e. "major projects", "lighthouse projects", "case studies", "key projects".

Criteria for selecting 'not published':

* The information is not published. For activity level questions, this
information is not being published for any of the projects assessed.

##Submitting the survey

If you are unable to finish answering all questions in a single session or would like to review your responses again before you submit the survey, please click on the 'save' button. You can return to your saved results by logging in again. 

Once you have completed the survey, please click on the 'submit' button at the bottom of the page. The survey will then be reviewed by Publish What You Fund before being sent to the donor for final comments. 

Thank you for completing this survey. If you have any questions or comments on using the Aid Transparency Tracker please get in touch: 2014tracker@publishwhatyoufund.org
